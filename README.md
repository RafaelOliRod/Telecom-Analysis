A good marketing strategy can be developed considering the specific features of the "Surf" and "Ultimate" plans, as well as customer data and usage patterns.

Analyze data from current users to identify specific customer groups with different usage patterns. This allows effective market segmentation, enabling the creation of personalized campaigns, as demonstrated by comparing NY-NJ and other regions.

Create personalized offers and promotions for each plan, encouraging users to migrate to the plan that best suits their needs. For example, offer discounts or bonuses for customers who choose to switch from the "Surf" plan to the "Ultimate" plan during a specific period. Despite having a smaller share in revenue, the "Ultimate" plan has a higher average payment and lower payment variability, providing better operational and financial planning for the future.

Loyalty Programs:
Introduce loyalty programs that reward customers for their loyalty. This may include additional benefits, discounts, or exclusive gifts for customers who remain on the plan for an extended period. The better the plan, the better the loyalty program.
